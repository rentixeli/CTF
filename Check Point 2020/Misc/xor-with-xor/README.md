```
from the challenge name we understand that we need to use xor on this one. after xoring with the key 'xor' we got a 1000 files in a zip.
i had to rename manually some of the files names.
now i combined them all like lego parts to 1 file. which was a wave file. after playing the wave file we've got the flag.
