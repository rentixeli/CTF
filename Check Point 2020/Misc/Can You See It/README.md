ok. on this one we get a 12.5h movie. 
after watching few secounds of it, we can understand that every frame theres a gray frame.
we also understand that theres 10 frames per sec.
lets extract all frames as pictures. now we've got about 450,000 pictures. not good.
lets extract all frames as pictures but we skip every 2nd frame (we dont need the gray ones) - weve got about 225,000
from now on I thought its a binary code. black and white . 0 and 1 but it wasnt.
so i tried to open one of the pictures and got a very tine picture.
i assumed that it might be a pixel challenge. so i combined all of the pixels to the max resolution I coulv'e get (using: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_resolutions)
and got the flag.
