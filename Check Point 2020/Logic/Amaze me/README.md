```
classic maze.
we wrote a script that runs in the maze and collects the location of itself. after getting some "Your distance from the treasure is" we can use math to get the treasure cordinates.
only need 3 points to calculate the exact location of the treasure. which gives us the flag.

> Special thanks to bymix for writting the script. and special thanks to kmkm133 for doing the math. <3
