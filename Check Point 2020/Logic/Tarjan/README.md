```
After googling tarjan we get Robert Tarjan. 
He created some algorithmes but only one of them was an algorithem that find the lowest common ancestors for pairs of nodes in a tree.
so we wrote a script that calculate that for us and got the flag.

> Special thanks to kmkm133 for writting the script and solving this one.
